# Amazon Clone 
### ðŸš¨ This is just my learning-based project:smile::smile::computer:

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v2.2)](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-2-2) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

It uses the new [`Just-in-Time Mode`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) for Tailwind CSS.

## Preview

## Running locally in development mode

To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`:

    git clone hhttps://github.com/LinnLatt7012/Amazone-clone.git
    npm install
    npm run dev

Note: If you are running on Windows run install --noptional flag (i.e. `npm install --no-optional`) which will skip installing fsevents.

## Building and deploying in production

If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with `npm run build` and run it with `npm start`:

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

You should run `npm run build` again any time you make changes to the site.

Note: If you are already running a webserver on port 80 (e.g. Macs usually have the Apache webserver running on port 80) you can still start the example in production mode by passing a different port as an Environment Variable when starting (e.g. `PORT=3000 npm start`).
